# Encryption--Decryption
This repository provides a secure framework for file encryption and decryption using hybrid cryptographic methods. It combines RSA for key encryption, AES-CBC for file content encryption, and HMAC for data integrity. The system supports key rotation and RSA digital signatures to ensure data authenticity and adaptability
